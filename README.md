# Selenium-Framework

This is selenium- cucumber framework implementing with TestNG runner.
This framework will generate a custom html report which is entirely different from 'maven-sure-fire' and other cucumber extend report which are available in many of the internet site as well as github repository.

To check the report structur before you go ahead to download the whole project, please download the entire 'Logs' folder from the given link -- [https://github.com/automationgod/Selenium-Framework/tree/master/BDD-Automation/Logs] 

I have shared one working copy of the entire project [maven], please download and do share your feedback on this.
